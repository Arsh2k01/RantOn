Size estimator and Virtual try on
As we have observed in the current e-commerce market, specifically in the fashion sector, there are a lot of returns and dissatisfied customers due to improper size and fit. We aim to solve that issue using certain AI and ML techniques so that shoppers can see if the item fits them or not with just one click and how will it look on them. Our solution uses a combination of computer vision, deep learning, and anthropomorphic science to deduct the positions and measurements of several body points from images taken by the users then matches these to the companyâ€™s size chart, previous databases on the size, and their body type. This then suggests the optimum size for the specific product and company. The customer can use the suggested size to demand items of their choice. Further virtual dressing room helps the customer get a feel of the fit and look of the product on their own body type, thus reducing confusion and providing a hassle-free shopping experience.
